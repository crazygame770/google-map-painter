Make a drawing tool that's NextJS compatible.
Create a map drawing tool called BaseMapper That allows a user to plan And draw maps for film set base camps. This tool should be like a geometry drawing tool similar to Google Slides, but with the ability to either load blueprints in the background or find, position and take screenshots from Google Maps Satellite images. the editor should also include pre-made Objects such as trucks , honey wagons , Tents, tables , Golf carts , cars And other items That are used in film set base camps. The tool also needs to allow the user to draw and label arrows, Connections, zones and other geometric shapes.
More instructions in the side letter.

Be careful with implementing APIs in a simple, single-source way.

Absolutely! Let me propose what we'll build for you.

I've created a plan for BaseMapper focusing on the core drawing functionality first. We'll start with basic canvas operations and pre-made objects, leaving complex features like Google Maps integration for future iterations. Would you like to review the plan and proceed with implementation?

I've been trying to set up the canvas with Fabric.js but running into some import issues. Would you like me to try a different approach, such as using a CDN version of Fabric.js or switching to an alternative canvas library?

I understand you want to switch to a different library for the canvas functionality. Let me suggest Konva.js - it's a powerful 2D canvas library with excellent support for:

Layers and groups
Complex shapes and paths
Image handling
Transformations and animations
Built-in event system
Great TypeScript support
I'll switch the implementation to use Konva.js instead of Fabric.js.

Google Maps integration for satellite imagery

I'll start implementing the Google Maps integration for satellite imagery. First, we'll need to set up the Google Maps JavaScript API and create a map selection interface. Let me check if we have the necessary API key.

20 hours ago
To integrate Google Maps for satellite imagery, we need a Google Maps JavaScript API key.
You can get this by:

Going to the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com)
Creating a project or selecting an existing one
Enabling the Maps JavaScript API
Creating credentials (API key)
Please provide your Google Maps API key. It usually starts with 'AIza'.

The map should always be there really, because the user needs to draw real world items with real meter lengths into a real map. So the map should be the background and then we should be able to overlay a grid that's 10m x 10m but give the user options of changing the grid size. The map should be rotate-able so we can line it up to the grid as needed.

I understand that you want to modify the map integration to be a permanent background layer with a configurable metric grid overlay. I'll update the implementation to:

Amazing, it's loading!! We need to be a bit carful here - the map and the grid need to be in lockstep zoom wide, so that the grid displays exactly measurements that correspond to the map. The map should zoom in and out through us pinching in mobile, scrolling on desktop and a +/- sign as a backup. We should treat the map like an infinite background instead of an element. We should separately control the orientation/ rotation of the map so that we can i.e. line up diagonal roads with our grid. But that should only be controlled via a bit circular button or so. Have the rotation and zoom buttons on the bottom of the map interface.

I'll update the map integration to handle zoom and rotation separately, with the map acting as an infinite background and proper grid scaling. I'll also add zoom controls and a rotation button at the bottom of the interface.

Very good! The map isn't "infinite", i.e. while the zoom buttons zoom out and the map is in lockstep with the grid, the map doesn't fill out new space as we zoom away. See screenshot:
